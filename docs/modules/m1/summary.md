# Reflecting on the Module

This module has introduced concepts and techniques that allow you to create
robust solutions to problems and express them in a general and reusable way.
You’ve had practice in problem solving through applying general solution
patterns, writing rigorous tests for the programs you create, and using the
abstraction features in Java to write generalized code. 

Take time now to review and reflect on this module and the work you've done.

- What did you learn?
- How might this help you in upcoming modules?
- What are you still unsure about, and what questions do you have?
- Is there any work that you left undone? Is there still time to complete it?
- Are you satisfied with the way in which you completed this module, and with the way you managed your time?
- How might you improve your workflow and study habits for the next module?

Taking time to 
[reflect on your experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice), rather than
just moving on, can be an important part of learning and getting better - not
just in school, but on the job and in life.
