# Getting Started With Canvas

[Instructure Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/higher-education) is
the learning management system (LMS) used by Auburn, and it is utilized
heavily in this course. Canvas is your primary course portal, providing access
to all course content including graded items.

Take the following steps to familiarize yourself with Canvas.

1. Click on **Announcements** in the left menu. Make sure you read the announcements already posted and understand where to check back regularly for upcoming course announcements and news.

1. Click on **Syllabus** in the left menu. Read the official course syllabus, paying careful attention to all the course policies and the grading policy in particular. Notice that the bottom part of this page in Canvas contains a chronological list of all course deliverables along with the date and time each is due.

1. Click on **Modules** in the left menu. Make sure you are able to navigate through the course via this menu option. Notice the dates when each module is scheduled to open.

1. Click on **Assignments** in the left menu. This page in Canvas allows you to scroll through all graded items in the course as well as search for a particular item. **Note:** *Canvas uses the term "assignment" in a general sense to mean any element of the course that has a score or grade. Thus, the Canvas term "assignment" includes several different types of graded deliverables in this course.* To familiarize yourself with this page in Canvas, do the following:

	- Click the *Show by Date* button to see a reverse-chronological listing of all graded items.
	- Click the *Show By Type* button to see a listing of all graded items organized into course grading categories. Notice that the weight of each category is displayed.
	- Click in the *Search for Assignment* text box and search for a particular item. For example, enter "Exam 1" in the search box and press the Enter key.

1. Click on **Grades** in the left menu. This page in Canvas allows you to check your current grades as well as do a what-if analysis on ungraded items. To familiarize yourself with this page in Canvas, do the following:

	- Explore and exercise the various display ordering options available in the *Arrange By* feature in the top left of the page.
	- Notice how your "Total" numeric score along with the corresponding letter grade is displayed in the top right of the page.
	- Scroll to the bottom of the page to see your current course score and how it is calculated according to the grading category weights.
	- Toggle the *Show All Details* on and off to see what information is displayed.
	- Explore and exercise the what-if analysis feature by changing the score on some graded item. Notice how Canvas updates your projected grade to reflect your entered what-if score. Reload the page and see how Canvas resets the what-if score to its real value, but adds a button to allow you to review the what-if score you had entered.


## Time Zone Setting

Times for all course events (assignment deadlines, exam times, etc.) will be
set in US [Central Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ct), which may
not correspond to the time zone in which you will be living and studying this
fall. You are responsible for meeting deadlines in Central Time regardless of
what your local time zone may be. You may find it helpful to follow the
instructions linked
[here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414)
to have Canvas show deadlines appropriately in your local time zone to avoid
any confusion.


## Announcement Notification Setting

You are responsible for the information in all course announcements. Follow
the steps in the video

preferences and specify that all course alerts are routed to your Auburn

The Canvas Dashboard can be set to one of three views: *Card View*, *List View*, and *Recent Activity View*. You will want to [configure your Dashboard](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Dashboard-as-a-student/ta-p/512) to the view that you prefer.
