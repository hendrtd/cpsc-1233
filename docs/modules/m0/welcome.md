# Welcome to COMP 2210!

This is the data structures and algorithms course at Auburn, and it is one of
the cornerstone courses for several majors, including Computer Science,
Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In this course, you will learn
about developing programs that use data structures and collections to
efficiently store data. Emphasis will be placed on the interplay between
effective data structures and efficient algorithms.

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Create, verify, and assess computational solutions in Java.
- Create, verify, and assess software components that are expressed at a high level of abstraction.
- Apply standard problem-solving strategies in the creation of solutions.
- Demonstrate the behavior of standard collections and data structures.
- Analyze and assess standard collections and data structures with respect to efficiency and use case.
- Apply standard collections, data structures, and associated algorithms in the creation of solutions.
- Assess algorithms and software components with respect to time complexity.
