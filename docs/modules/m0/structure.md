# Course Structure

This course is organized into eight modules numbered
[zero](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html)
through seven. Module 0 is an introductory "getting started" module, while
Module 1 through Module 7 are course-content modules. Rather than being
organized strictly by content, these modules are
[timeboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing); that is, M1 - M7 are
of fixed, equal durations with specific tasks to be completed within each. (If
you're familiar with 
[agile methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development),
you'll recognize similarities to
[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) sprints.)

Scheduling, planning, and knowing when things are due are easy with timeboxed
modules. All graded items are scheduled to be due or delivered on module
boundaries. Specifically: **Each graded item in the course is due on the last
day of the module that contains it.** There are late days for assignments and
slip days for exams, tests, and activities, but the actual due date for
everything is the last day of each module.

The timeboxed organization of the course is as follows. Module 0 begins on the
first day of classes for the term and ends on the first Sunday of the term.
Each module 1-7 begins on a Monday and ends on the following Sunday. 

Here is the specific schedule for [this term](http://online.auburn.edu/term_calendar).

# Module Structure

Each of the seven content modules has the same structure with the following components.

- **Module Overview:** A brief introduction to the module content.
- **Module At-A-Glance:** A more complete description of the module focus, tips
  for success, and learning objectives.
- **Instructional Resources:** Links to complete lecture notes for the module
  and references to associated readings from textbooks.
- **Lectures:** Links to complete instructional videos tied to the lecture
  notes.
- **Hands-On Activities:** One or more activities designed to help you put into
  practice some of the topics being presented in the notes.
- **Programming Assignment:** An assignment that requires you to implement a
  software solution to a given problem. The assignment relates to the content of
  the current and/or previous modules.
- **Summary:** A brief recap of what was covered in the module.

In addition to these common elements, Module 2, 4, and 7 have:

- **Lab Test:** A timed programming test that requires you to implement software
  solutions for small, focused problems. While a programming assignment measures
  your ability to solve a larger problem over a longer period, the lab tests are
  designed to measure your ability to solve small problems quickly. Doing this
  requires that you have internalized and mastered basic problem solving skills,
  basic programming skills, and appropriate language knowledge. A lab test is
  very much a test of your *fluency*.
- **Exam:** A timed Canvas quiz that tests your overall mastery of the content
  in the current module and one or more previous modules.


# Workflow

Since each content module has the same structure, you can apply the same process
to going through each. Here is a suggested
[workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) for going through each module
of this course.

Notice the iterative nature of the items in the *Work & Learn*
[swimlane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane). Rather than going through
this portion of the module sequentially, I strongly encourage you to take an
[iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration) approach. Read a portion of
the notes, then watch the associated lecture videos, and then do the associated
hands-on activities (if any). I also suggest that you start the assignment at
the beginning of the module and interleave your work on the assignment with the
notes/lecture/hands-on cycle. Since most assignments are based on material
covered in previous modules, this interleaving is easy to do.
