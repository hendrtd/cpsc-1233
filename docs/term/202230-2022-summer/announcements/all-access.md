## What is All Access?

All Access is Auburn’s program of delivering course materials to you digitally.
Sometimes this will be a textbook, sometimes an access code. Your instructor has
coordinated with the Bookstore to deliver this content for the course and help
make sure you have what you need. All Access makes sure you are ready the first
day of class, and the material is so much cheaper with this delivery that it’s
the best way we can help you succeed in your courses at Auburn - financially and
academically.

## What content am I getting?

For this course, CPSC 1230, you’re getting access for the semester to Vocareum
cloudLab access.

## How do I find it?

Codes for CloudLab were emailed from `noreply@auburn.edu` on August 15 with
instructions on how to redeem/get access.

## What does it cost?

For the first week of class, everyone gets this content for free.  All students
in this course start as opted in to pay for the content for the course. The
discounted price you’ll be billed is $21.95 for the CloudLab access. If you want
to opt out and not be charged, all you have to do is follow the instructions
(see
[https://www.aubookstore.com/t-txt_allaccessoptout1.aspx](https://www.aubookstore.com/t-txt_allaccessoptout1.aspx)).
You’ll lose access at the end of the first week, unless you’ve purchased it on
your own.

## How do I pay?

If you’re still opted in on May 24, then we’ll send the charge to your next
ebill.  This will be labeled as the course on your ebill so you’ll know. You’ll
get a reminder on January 18 to remind you about the deadline.

## What if I'm on scholarship?

We can charge All Access content to any scholarship that we charge at the
Bookstore.  Those will be done automatically when we bill.

## What is the refund policy?

After the opt out deadline, we can only offer refunds to students who have
dropped the course or withdrawn from the university. That’s why the opt out
deadline will be crucial for you to decide if you want to be charged or not.

## What if I need help?

- Remember to check your email for zybooks info.  

- For most digital content in All Access, Google Chrome works best as a browser
  and you’ll want to make sure it’s up to date.  

- I’m always happy to help as well, especially if you have a question about All
  Access or something doesn't look right.  Russell Weldon `books@auburn.edu` or
